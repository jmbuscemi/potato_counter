# Potato Counter
There are times when an instructor is teaching a Ruby (and Rails) course, that the said instructor needs to, you know, teach a concept or two.  Maybe it's doing something like create a method, or a class, or a module, or an entire app.  Sometimes, these concepts need to be demonstrated on the fly using the word **_potato_**.  You know things like:

```ruby
def potato
  "Grow some spuds"
end
```
<p align="center">OR</p>

```ruby
class Potato
  def spuds
    "Baby potatoes"
  end
end
```

<p align="center">OR</p>

<p align="center">`rails new Potato`</p>


Yes, an entire app based on potatoes complete with a mailer to let you know when spuds are created.

To be completely honest though, these types of trivial objects (_everything in Ruby is an object_) and apps get the point across nicely.


### But I digress...
This app counts how many times the word **potato** was used in teaching a cohort at The Iron Yard

It's simple, and just for fun!

Mason, it's my way of saying you do a great job.
